From VS:

Open Team Explorer
Click Source Control Explorer
In the nav bar of the tool window there is a drop down labeled "Workspaces".
Extend it and click on the "Workspaces..." option (yeah, a bit un-intuitive)


The "Manage Workspaces" window comes up. Click edit and you can add / remove / edit your workspace
Alternative

Call "tf workspace" from a developer command promt. It will bring up the "Manage Workspaces" directly!
